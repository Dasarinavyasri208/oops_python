#Task1: Truck
Now we need a Truck in our cars world.
A truck is a Car but with the following additional behaviours

Truck horn sounds “Honk Honk”
Truck can load some cargo within max_cargo_weight
Truck can load & unload the cargo only when the truck is at rest
load & unload method expect cargo_weight as argument which is a positive integer. Incase of invalid data raise the ValueError as shown in below code samples
Coding Guidelines:

In case of invalid data during the creation of car. Your code should raise ValueError as mentioned in the below code sample
>>> truck = Truck(color="Red", max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3, max_cargo_weight=100)  
>>> truck.load(50)  
>>> truck.load(100)  
Cannot load cargo more than max limit: 100  
>>> truck.load(-100) 
ValueError: Invalid value for cargo_weight

>>> truck = Truck(color="Red", max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3, max_cargo_weight=100)  
>>> truck.start_engine()  
>>> truck.accelerate()  
>>> truck.load(50) # Prints
Cannot load cargo during motion 
>>> truck.sound_horn() # Prints
Honk Honk  

>>> truck = Truck(color="Red", max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3, max_cargo_weight=100)  
>>> truck.start_engine() 
>>> truck.load(50)
>>> truck.accelerate()  
>>> truck.unload(50) # Prints
Cannot unload cargo during motion 
>>> truck.sound_horn() # Prints
Honk Honk  

>>> truck = Truck(color="Red", max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3, max_cargo_weight=100)  
>>> truck.start_engine() 
>>> truck.load(50)
>>> truck.unload(80)
>>> truck.load(100) # Prints
Cannot load cargo more than max limit: 100  
>>> truck.unload(50)
>>> truck.load(100)
