# Task3
# Trainer
A Pokemon trainer is described by his/her

name: any string with which a trainer is referred, just like a name for humans.
experience: represents the experience of the trainer. experience is 100 for a newly created trainer. Every time a trainer catches a pokemon, his/her experience is increased (details are mentioned at catch method below)
max_food_in_bag: represents the max amount of food a trainer can carry along with him/her. max_food_in_bag increases with the trainers experience. i.e max_food_in_bag is equal to 10 x experience.
food_in_bag: represents the current amount of food a trainer has.

>>> trainer.name
Bot
>>> trainer.experience
100
>>> print(trainer)
Bot
>>> trainer.max_food_in_bag
1000
>>> trainer.food_in_bag
0
# Task4
Trainers travel from one island to another to catch pokemon and gather food. Trainers should be shown all the available islands.

>>> Island.get_all_islands()
[Island1 - 100 pokemon - 10000 food,
Island2 - 24 pokemon - 12300 food,
Island3 - 82 pokemon - 11830 food,
Island4 - 192 pokemon - 101238 food]
Should return a list of island objects

# Task5
Trainer can move from one island to another.
>>> trainer.move_to_island(island1)
>>> trainer.current_island == island1
True
>>> trainer.current_island  
Island1 - 0 pokemon - 10000 - food
If trainer is not on any island current_island should return the message mentioned below.
>>> trainer.current_island  # Print
You are not on any island
# Task6
Trainers can collect food from the island and store it in their bag.
>>> trainer.move_to_island(island)
>>> island.total_food_available_in_kgs
10000
>>> trainer.food_in_bag
0
>>> trainer.collect_food()
>>> island.total_food_available_in_kgs
9000
>>> trainer.food_in_bag

Trainer fills his/her bag with food just by calling the collect_food method once.
>>> island.total_food_available_in_kgs
9900
>>> trainer.food_in_bag
1000
>>> trainer.max_food_in_bag
1000
>>> trainer.collect_food()
>>> trainer.food_in_bag
1000
>>> island.total_food_available_in_kgs
9900
When a trainer collects food from an island, food in the island is decreased by the same amount.

If the trainer bag is full i.e., food_in_bag is equal to max_food_in_bag then collect_food doesn't decrease food on the island and also doesn't increase the food_in_bag.

If trainer is not on any island collect_food should behave as mentioned below.

>>> trainer.current_island  # Print
You are not on any island

>>> trainer.collect_food()  # Print
Move to an island to collect food
If the food on the island is less than the food required by the trainer, then your code should behave as below.
>>> island.total_food_available_in_kgs
90
>>> trainer.food_in_bag
0
>>> trainer.experience
100
>>> trainer.max_food_in_bag
1000
>>> trainer.collect_food()
>>> trainer.food_in_bag
